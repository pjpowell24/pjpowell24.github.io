<h1>Welcome to Page Powell's Site!</h1>
<p>I am currently a Senior at SMU and an Majoring in Creative Computing with a Minor in Advertising. One of my favorite things to do is travel and spend time at the beach. I hope to one day
 visit most of the countries in the world. Another one of my favorite things to do is listen to music as I like a diversity of different genres such as Pop, RnB, Country, and Indie. I am interested
  in UX/UI Design and 3D animation and hope to continue learning more in the future!
